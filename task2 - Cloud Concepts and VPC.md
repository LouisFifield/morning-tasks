# Cloud Concepts and VPC
​
1. What are the difference between a server and your computer?
​
Both servers and our home computers (clients) are essentially computers which both provide servers, programs and data. However, servers are located at data centres and are used to provide services to home computers which are also known as clients. 


2. How can you tell whether an IP address is public or private?

The internet protocol address (IP address) is the address which identifies a particular device connected to a network. Systems and devices can have IP addresses. Private IP addresses are use to communicate with devices an systems on a local network. Private IPs These are assigned to each device in the local network by the network router and allow devices to communicate with one another on the local network, i.e. your computer communicating with your printer.  Public IP address are used to communicate with other systems outside of the local network and are assigned to your local network by your internet service providers. 

3. Explain in your own words the difference between Cloud, Hybrid, and On-Premises deployment models.

Cloud, hybrid and On-premises computing are all models for deploying software applications. Cloud models use remote servers whose capacity and power are rented from cloud service providers. Applications run 100% from the cloud, including operation, storage and all the functionality from the services provided by the cloud service providers. 

Hybrid deployment works by companies using their own local on-premises infrastructure as well as external cloud services to run their applications. An example of this is where high security sensitive data may be stored on-premises whereas the less sensitive functionality of the application may run on the cloud for the purposes of scalability, cost effectiveness and flexibility. 

On-premises models deploy applications on the organisations own infrastructure and local datacentres. This situation provides the advantages of security, however it has the disadvantages of high upfront costs for hardware and infrastructure, costs for operations and maintenance and difficulties when it comes to growth and scaling the architecture.
