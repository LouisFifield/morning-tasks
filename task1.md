# DevOps and The Cloud
​
Do some research to answer the following questions in your own words as best as you can.
​
1. What is DevOps?
​
In traditional models of application development, the developers and operations teams work independently of each other. DevOps is a model/practice where a team of engineers do not limit themselves to a single function, but work and develop skills across the whole lifecycle of a application product. From development, testing, deployment, operations. The  model enables applications to get up and running smoothly and ensures that the application remains running. They use automation and tools, which empowers developers to be able to deploy applications quickly and effectively. 

​
2. What are the 3 ways of DevOps and what do they mean in your own words?
​
The Three Ways of DevOps
	1. Flow
		a. It is important in process of development to begin with the end goal of the application in mind, and move toward this goal as quickly as possible. Issues should be able to be identified rapidly and improvements should be able to be made smoothly as possible. 
		
	2. Feedback Loops
		a. High quality, regular feedback of how application is performing is essential. It is easier to fix problems when they are new and small coming straight from developers compared to when they are not fresh in the developers mind and have grown larger in scale. 
		
	3. Continuous Experimentation and Learning
		a. When work flow is smooth and feedback is effective, we have the foundations which allow for experimentation and learning. In addition to these foundations, we can add an iterative process, which documents experiences and results and continuously improves on past iterations of the product. This principle not only relates to the software development but also to the team, where it is recommended that 20% of engineers time should be dedicated to learning and growth. 

​
3. What do you think a DevOps Engineer does as part of a team?
​
As part of an IT team a DevOps engineer acts as a bridging link between the operations and development team. They help support the culture of DevOps and collaboration between the two teams in a company. On a day to day basis, they code, manage infrastructure, conduct systems administration, work with DevOps tools and spend time communicating between the two teams to encourage cohesion and streamlining of practice. 
​
4. What do you think the most important qualities of a DevOps or Cloud engineer are?
​
Some of the most important qualities of a DevOps Engineer are continuous learning. The industry is continuously developing and it is important to have a commitment to learning and development in order to be able to understand the best practices, tools and technology that are going to support the development, deployment and operation of applications.  

In addition to learning, it is important to have a strong aptitude for logical thinking and the ability to interact with technical tools, practices and processes. As such DevOps engineers will have an ability to code and script, work with containers, infrastructure and various cloud platforms. 

Finally, as DevOps is a philosophy and working culture which is all about integrating groups of people. Communication, team work and collaboration are essential traits which must be used on a daily basis to be able to fulfil the role of DevOps engineer.
