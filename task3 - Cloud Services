# Cloud Services
​
Decide whether the following AWS services are Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), Software as a service (SaaS), or Serverless and give your reasoning.
​
EC2 - Functions as Infrastructure as a Service. It provides users with a virtual machine on the AWS servers. This service can scale depending on what the user requires. But only provides the user with computational power in order for them to carry out whatever function it is that they need. 
​
S3 - I am not 100% sure about whether S3 is IaaS or PaaS, I am leaning towards considering it as platform, as it has computational functionality in order to know where data is being stored. However, it is raw hard-drive space which is on the cloud which suggests that it could be Infrastructure as a service.
​
RDS - This service functions as PaaS, it is not a software and is not infrastrcutre, but it offers a platform for relational data to be managed.
​
Lambda - This is a serverless service which allows functions to be run when the the code is triggered by an event. This code is only run when it is needed and the servers powering the code scale when they are required.
​
EKS - This service is a PaaS. 
​
DynamoDB - This is a serverless database system as you do not need to directly provision or manage the servers.
​
ECR - This service functions a PaaS, it provides a platform for container images.
